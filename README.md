## Introduction ##
This is a version of the snake game that I rewrote in C++ using the ncurses library. This game is played in a terminal or terminal emulator, and uses all ascii characters. At this current moment the game does not use any colors either. The game will automatically size itself to your terminal when it is started, but for a optimal playing experience I would reccommend using a smaller window to run the game.This game has been run and tested on Linux only. It has not been tested on OSX/Mac OS, or Windows.
